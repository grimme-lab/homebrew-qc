## Developer Notes

### How to update the formulae

1. Switch to a new branch on your fork of the repository
2. Update the formulae in the `Formula` directory (e.g., `mctc-lib.rb`), keeping the following style:

```ruby
url "https://github.com/grimme-lab/mctc-lib/archive/refs/tags/v0.3.2.tar.gz"
sha256 "b18b06f80e6274b353dd091c12b3a83217033ce0bd80471b54cf486cc60c0251"
```
The `sha256` hash can be obtained by running
```sh
curl -sL "https://github.com/grimme-lab/mctc-lib/archive/refs/tags/v0.3.2.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256 | cut -d " " -f 1
```

3. Commit the changes and push to your fork. Within the same branch (PR), **DO NOT** change anything else.
4. Create a pull request to the main repository. **DO NOT** put the `pr-pull` label on it yet.
5. Make sure that the tests `.github/workflows/tests.yml` pass and that the bottles are uploaded correctly for each platform.
   - You can check the `artifacts` manually by downloading them from the GitHub Actions summary of your PR (scroll down).
6. After all tests have passed and the `artifacts` are available, request a review from the repository maintainers.
7. After approval, label the PR with the `pr-pull` label to trigger the merge action (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`).
8. The PR should look roughly as follows:

    <img src="assets/sample-pr.png" width="400" alt="Exemplary pull request." />

There is a blog entry on how the process should look like [here](https://brew.sh/2020/11/18/homebrew-tap-with-bottles-uploaded-to-github-releases/).
